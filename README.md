## Description
This project is made alongside a bachelor project report for AAU, focusing increasing the robustness of Dominant against a greedy camouflaging attack.
It takes a dataset and injects it with anomalies, it then detects the performance of GAD methods at different iterations of the camouflaging attack.
It provides tools to visualize this performance, and can be adjusted as needed.
